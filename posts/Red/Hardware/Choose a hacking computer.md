RAM : min 16 Go
ROM : SSD (mandatory) => min 512 Go
CPU : Intel core
- look at the generation (always take a recent gen), example : I5 **12**500H  is a I5 of generation 12th
- don't look at the frequency (in GHz) and don't look at the processor family (i3, i5, i7, i9)
- go on benchmark websites and compare their score:
  - geekbench
  - 3Dmark
  - Cinebench
- min (1 socket, quadcore, 2 thread per core so 8 cpu in total)
GPU : None (more battery consumption and more weight and size for the computer)
