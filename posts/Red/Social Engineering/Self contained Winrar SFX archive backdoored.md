Using winrar, you can bundle a winrar extractor in your archive : Â [https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x19sscu](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x19sscu)
this way the archive is a .exe that is capable to extract it's content without winrar installed.
You can backdoor this exe (for example using [backdoor factory](https://www.kali.org/tools/backdoor-factory/#:~:text=Injects%20shellcode%20into%20win32%2F64,on%20all%20ELF%2FPE%20files.))
