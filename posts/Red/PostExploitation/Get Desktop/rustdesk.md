> This remote desktop solution is very noisy (since the user can see an alert message and this is a GUI application). But it's very seamless and pleasant to use

RustDesk is a remote access and remote control software, allowing maintenance of computers and other devices. The RustDesk client is available for different operating systems. RustDesk has the aspiration to be an open source alternative for Remote desktop software like TeamViewer or AnyDesk. Therefore, RustDesk is able to function without additional tools like VPNs or port forwardings, even behind firewalls or NATs.

Prefer to use nightly builds : https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/tag/nightly
How it work : https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/wiki/How-does-RustDesk-work%3F

### Setup

On the target, download the nightly build, and as an administrator **INSTALL** rustdesk on the computer. Warning, the installer is a GUI application, so you need to already have a remote desktop solution like rdp or vnc to continue the installation and the configuration.

Once installed a rustdesk service will run indifinitely on the target, gaining persistence and surviving to reboot.

Then, in rustdesk settings, configure and ID, a fixed Password and configure a self hosted server

On the attacker machine, you just have to connect using the previous credentials
