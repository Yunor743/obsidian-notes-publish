I am the only one to maintain this methodology, so I would like to remind you that a single human being is always sensitive to make mistakes or imprecisions, however I am always listening to your feedback and I would be happy to integrate them into this methodology if they seem relevant to me.  
Furthermore I would like to remind you that some of the shared resources may be inaccurate or controversial.  
I personally consider that any resource allowing to progress in its education is good to take and should be shared to the greatest number without any censorship or restriction that it is penal, legal or others  
I am only summarizing information and resources that can theoretically be used to educate oneself on a subject  
I am not responsible for any misuse resulting from the use or sharing of the resources presented in this methodology  

I would like to remind my readers to always keep an ethical and professional conscience, and to always stay on the right side of the law.  
Never stop learning
